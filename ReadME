This project aims to predict the likelihood of credit card default by analyzing customer financial and demographic data. 
We apply machine learning models including decision trees, random forests, and boosted decision trees, 
with 5-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.
The goal is to evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, 
and ROC AUC to identify the most effective approach for default risk prediction.
